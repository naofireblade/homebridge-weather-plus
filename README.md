## Installation

1. Install homebridge using: `npm install -g homebridge`
2. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-weather-plus` *Note: The installation might take 5 minutes.*
3. Gather an API key for a weather service from the register link in the table above
4. Update your configuration file. See the samples below.

## Configuration

Below are example configurations for all weather apis.

### Dark Sky

The **key** parameter is the API key that you get by registering for the Dark Sky service.

The **locationGeo** parameter must be a list with the latitude longitude for your location (dont forget the square brackets). You can use this page to find your coordinates: http://www.mapcoordinates.net/en.

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "WeatherPlus",
		"name": "WeatherPlus",
		"service": "darksky",
		"key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"locationGeo": [52.5200066, 13.404954]
	}
]
```

### OpenWeatherMap

The **key** parameter is the API key that you get by registering for the OpenWeather service

**Please choose from one of these location properties.**

The **location** parameter must be a numerical unique city-id (can be found [here](https://openweathermap.org/find))

The **locationCity** parameter must be a city-name with an optional country code e.g. "Berlin, DE" (you can check it [here](https://openweathermap.org/find))

The **locationGeo** parameter must be a list with the latitude longitude for your location (don't forget the square brackets). You can use this page to find your coordinates: http://www.mapcoordinates.net/en.

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "WeatherPlus",
		"name": "WeatherPlus",
		"service": "openweathermap",
		"key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"location": 2950159,
		"locationCity": "Berlin, DE",
		"locationGeo": [52.5200066, 13.404954],
	}
]
```

### Yahoo

The **location** parameter is a text for finding a location with YQL (see [here](https://developer.yahoo.com/weather/))

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "WeatherPlus",
		"name": "WeatherPlus",
		"service": "yahoo",
		"location": "Berlin, DE",
		"forecast": [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
	}
]
```

### Weather Underground

The **location** parameter can be a city name or a zip. You can also use a station from the **[Personal Weather Station Network](https://www.wunderground.com/weatherstation/overview.asp)** to receive weather information. Just enter pws:YOURID.

The **key** parameter is the API key that you get by registering for the Weather Underground service

```json
"platforms": [
	{
		"platform": "WeatherPlus",
		"name": "WeatherPlus",
		"service": "weatherunderground",
		"key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
		"location": "New York",
		"forecast": [1,2,3,4]
	}
]
```

## Advanced Configuration

Below are explanations for all advanced parameters of this plugin. Most parameters are *optional*. 

The **forecast** parameter is *optional* and defines a list of forecast days with 1 for today, 2 for tomorrow etc. Default are none.

The **interval** parameter is *optional* and sets the update interval in minutes. The default is 4 minutes because the rate for free API keys is limited. This parameter is global for all weather accessories.

The **units** parameter is *optional* and sets the conventions used for reporting values. The default is "metric". This parameter is global for all weather accessories. The choices are:

- "si" (or "metric")
- "us" (or "imperial")
- "ca" to report wind speeds in km/h instead of m/s
- "uk" to report visibility in miles and wind speeds in km/h instead of m/s

The **language** parameter is *optional* and sets the translation for the description of the day and the weather report for each API. Available languages can be found [here](https://github.com/darkskyapp/translations/tree/master/lib/lang). The default is en.

The **forecast** parameter is *optional* and defines a list of forecast days with 1 for today, 2 for tomorrow etc. The default is none.

The **displayName** parameter is *optional* and sets the CurrentConditons accessory's name. The default is "Now". **IMPORTANT NOTE:** If setting multiple weather accessories, ensure that each accessory has a unique name, or you will get an error from *homebridge*. If you do not set this parameter the plugin will take care of that.

The **displayNameForecast** parameter is *optional* and sets the Forecast accessories name. If the **forecast** parameter is present, then the names of the forecasts are prefixed with the displayNameForecast parameter. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** If setting multiple weather accessories, ensure that each accessory has a unique name, or you will get an error from *homebridge*. If you do not set this parameter the plugin will take care of that.

The **currentObservations** parameter is *optional* and sets how the 3 current observations temperature, humidity and pressure are displayed. You can choose one of these 2 options:

- "eve" (this combines all 3 values into one row in the eve app but shows nothing in the Apple Home app)
- "normal" (default, this shows all 3 values in a seperate row in the eve app and shows the temperature in the Apple Home app)

The **fakegatoParameters** parameter is *optional*. By default, history is persisted on filesystem. You can pass your own parameters to *fakegato-history* module using this paramter, in order to change the location of the persisted file or use GoogleDrive persistance. See https://github.com/simont77/fakegato-history#file-system and https://github.com/simont77/fakegato-history#google-drive for more info. **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Do not modify the parameter for the fakegato internal timer.

The **serial** parameter is *optional* and sets the Serial Number of the accessory. If it's not provided the serial number will be set to the **location** if present, or to 999 if not. Note that for proper operation of fakegato when multiple fakegato-enabled weather accessories are present in your system, the serial number must be unique.

### Example

```json
"platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "WeatherPlus",
            "name": "WeatherPlus",
            "interval": 5,
            "displayName":"Conditions OWM",
            "displayNameForecast":"Forecast OWM",
            "service": "openweathermap",
            "key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
            "forecast": [1,2],
            "locationGeo": [45.4999952, 9.3061655],
            "serial": "OWM"                        
        }
    ]
```

## Multiple Stations Configuration

You can set up multiple stations for different locations and/or weather services by putting your configuration in an **stations** array. The parameters **interval** and **units** are global to all accessories, and must be set at the top level. 

### Example

```json
"platforms": [
        {
            "platform": "WeatherPlus",
            "name": "WeatherPlus",
            "interval": 5,
            "units": "si",
            "stations":[{
                "displayName":"Conditions OWM",
                "displayNameForecast":"Forecast OWM",
                "service": "openweathermap",
                "key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
                "forecast": [1,2],
                "locationGeo": [45.4999952, 9.3061655],
                "serial": "OWM" 
            },{
                "displayName":"Conditions DS",
                "displayNameForecast":"Forecast DS",
                "service": "darksky",
                "key": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
                "forecast": [1,2],
                "locationGeo": [45.4999952, 9.3061655],
                "serial": "DS",
            }]
        }
    ]
```

## Example Use Cases

- Switch on a blue light in the morning when the chance for rain is above 20% today (or white when the forecast condition is snow / yellow when it's sunny).
- Start your automatic garden irrigation in the evening, depending on the amount of rain today and the forecast for tomorrow.

**Hint:** To trigger rules based on time and weather condition you will need a plugin like [homebridge-delay-switch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-delay-switch). Create a dummy switch that resets after some seconds. Set this switch to on with a timed rule. Then create a condition rule that triggers when the switch goes on depending on weather conditions of your choice.
